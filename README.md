# FlexBox-Froggy-Practice
Recording the answers to the excersizes I did in https://flexboxfroggy.com/ to better learn Flexbox. I learned how to use

justify-content
align-items
flex-direction
order
align-self
flex-wrap
flex-flow
align-content

I also learned that I probably should have kept all of these questions in main and just added a new file with a desciptive title (ex. question 1) besides making a new branch.
